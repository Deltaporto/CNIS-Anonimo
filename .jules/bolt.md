## 2026-08-03 - Optimize _globalizar RegExp flags deduplication
**Learning:** In hot path functions like `_globalizar` that run inside nested loops for regex construction, using `[...new Set(string.split(''))].join('')` introduces critical memory allocation overhead due to continuous Array and Set creations.
**Action:** Always replace small string deduplications with string concatenation and `.includes()` checks when operating inside performance-sensitive processing loops to avoid excessive GC pressure and CPU churn.
